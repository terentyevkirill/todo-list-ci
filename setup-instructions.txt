To setup this tutorial 
1.) make a c9 php mysql workspace
2.) download codeigniter 3.1.5 from codeigniter.com 
3.) extract and transfer all the codeigniter files to the c9 workspace 
4.) Install php my admin using the instructions here: 
https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-phpmyadmin/1723
that means basically just run in your terminal: 
phpmyadmin-ctl install 
& 
mysql-ctl start 
then you can access phpmyadmin at your the URL for your workspace/phpmyadmin 
codeigniter-tutorial-msrinteractive.c9users.io/phpmyadmin [our example]
5.) in application folder / config / database.php 
add your c9 username to the database config where it says 'username'
and add 'c9' as the database
the password should be left blank by default, unless you have changed your mySQL password
6.) Create a .htaccess file in the root of your project with the following contents 

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/(index\.php|images|img|assets|newdesign[^/]*|cache[^/]*)$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [L]

7.) in your config folder / config.php  
on line 38 - to an empty string 
$config['index_page'] = '';
and 
on line 26 to our base URL 
$config['base_url'] = 'https://codeigniter-tutorial-msrinteractive.c9users.io/';
Once you've added this line, add 
$this->load->helper('url');
to your MY_Controller constructor method. That will load the helper so that you can use site_url() to echo the site url. 

8.) Get the 'MY_MODEL' code igniter library from https://github.com/avenirer/CodeIgniter-MY_Model/blob/version-3.0/core/MY_Model.php 
(shortcut library for the model)
Copy the MY_Model.php file to your application/core folder 

9.) Create a My_Controller class inside a file called 'MY_Controller.php' in your core folder. 
(This acts as a main controller that will have global scope, so we can write methods here that can be called from our other controllers)

10.) You're ready to begin. 



OPTIONAL

You may grab the boilerplate code from https://github.com/msrinteractive/Boilerplate-a-mundo
Save it all to an assets folder outside of the application, and then map the css and js links to your assets folder 
<?php echo site_url('assets/'); ?> like that
